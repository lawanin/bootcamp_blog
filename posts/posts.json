We have been able to install the necessary software (R and Rstudio) on every computer except one which we are still troubleshooting. On 6/2, we met again with a class of 79 students, inclduding new members from last-minute recommendations. On 6/4, we held our third meeting with roughly 60 students.\nHeather had the early lead, catching the most and most major mistakes the first two days. As the errors were major, many expressed confusion in the Discord. Heather responded to nearly all of them.\n\n\n\nKudos to many, many others who have maintained a nice balance of asking and answering questions. It has been exciting to watch. Kudos also to Bryan (libryan261?), who asked a question, figured it out himself, and then posted how he solved it for the benefit of others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother shoutout to Ajay, who taught me how to format code better in Discord.\nA final shutout to Aryan, having rightly warned all to fear Preceptor. Kudos also to Matthew for his choice image.\n\n\n\nEarly Saturday afternoon, Ajay and Nuo did well in catching errors. These have been corrected in your update.\n\n\n\nAs of 6/5, the course has welcomed four students to its staff as teaching fellows: Heather Li, Nuo Wen Lei, Ajay Malik, and Stephanie Saab.\n\n\n\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"Names\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"Course Material\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"Date\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Emmanuel Buabeng\",\"2\":\"GS-Tut. 1.7\",\"3\":\"6/1\"},{\"1\":\"Frank Li\",\"2\":\"VisA 2.4\",\"3\":\"6/2\"},{\"1\":\"Stefan Arroyo-Cottier\",\"2\":\"VisA 6.5\",\"3\":\"6/2\"},{\"1\":\"Frank Li\",\"2\":\"VisA 4.3\",\"3\":\"6/2\"},{\"1\":\"Heather Li\",\"2\":\"VisB 2.6\",\"3\":\"6/2\"},{\"1\":\"Heather Li\",\"2\":\"VisB 5.6\",\"3\":\"6/2\"},{\"1\":\"Heather Li\",\"2\":\"VisB 3.2\",\"3\":\"6/2\"},{\"1\":\"Ajay Malik\",\"2\":\"Tools-Tex.\",\"3\":\"6/2\"},{\"1\":\"Nuo Wen Lei\",\"2\":\"Vis C 2.3\",\"3\":\"6/3\"},{\"1\":\"Nuo Wen Lei\",\"2\":\"VisC 5.2\",\"3\":\"6/3\"},{\"1\":\"Gabriel You\",\"2\":\"VisC 5.6\",\"3\":\"6/3\"},{\"1\":\"Frank Li\",\"2\":\"VisC 3.5\",\"3\":\"6/3\"},{\"1\":\"Yile Choi\",\"2\":\"VisA 3.5\",\"3\":\"6/3\"},{\"1\":\"Daniel Wang\",\"2\":\"VisC 5.7\",\"3\":\"6/3\"},{\"1\":\"Daniel Wang\",\"2\":\"VisC 4\",\"3\":\"6/3\"},{\"1\":\"Fahim Ahmed\",\"2\":\"GS-Tut. 1\",\"3\":\"6/3\"},{\"1\":\"Khush Makadia\",\"2\":\"VisC 7.8\",\"3\":\"6/3\"},{\"1\":\"Ajay Malik\",\"2\":\"Term 2.5\",\"3\":\"6/5\"},{\"1\":\"Nuo Wen Lei\",\"2\":\"Term 3.3\",\"3\":\"6/5\"},{\"1\":\"Nuo Wen Lei\",\"2\":\"Term 3.13\",\"3\":\"6/5\"},{\"1\":\"Nuo Wen Lei\",\"2\":\"Term 3.4\",\"3\":\"6/5\"},{\"1\":\"Nuo Wen Lei\",\"2\":\"Term 4.7\",\"3\":\"6/5\"},{\"1\":\"Ajay Malik\",\"2\":\"Term 4.2\",\"3\":\"6/5\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  \n\nIf you feel this list is incomplete, reach out to one of the course staff.\n\n\n\n",
